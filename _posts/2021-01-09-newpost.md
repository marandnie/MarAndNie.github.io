# Commands

Okay, soy today I learned that I can read a file with the cat **command**.
Cat
cat is a standard Unix utility that reads files sequentially, writing them to standard output. The name is derived from its function to concatenate files.

cat filename

for example I used it like this

cat /etc/resolv.conf

Another useful command is touch, it is used to create a file

touch filename

You can also use the echo command

echo > file.txt

or echo "This goes inside the file" > filename.txt
